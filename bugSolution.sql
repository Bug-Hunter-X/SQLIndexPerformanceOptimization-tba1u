To resolve these performance problems, several strategies can be applied. First, analyze query patterns and table sizes to determine if indices are truly necessary. For small tables, the overhead of using an index often outweighs any performance benefits.   Second, ensure that indexes are created on columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses.  Select the most selective columns to maximize the efficiency of index lookups. If you have multiple indexes, ensure that you are not including too many indexes.  Third, consider using techniques like query optimization and rewriting to reduce the reliance on indices. The choice of index type can also be important. For instance, if you have a lot of inserts, an index that's not clustered might impact write performance. Experiment with different techniques to find the solution that is best for you.  In some cases, dropping unnecessary indices and optimizing queries can yield significant performance improvements.
