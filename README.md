This repository demonstrates a common SQL performance issue related to the inefficient use of indexes. The `bug.sql` file contains example queries that showcase how poorly designed or unnecessary indices can severely impact query execution speed.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides alternative query strategies and index optimizations to remedy these performance bottlenecks.  The provided examples focus on scenarios where indexes unexpectedly hinder performance rather than improve it, such as with small tables or queries that don't use indexed columns effectively.  The repository also illustrates the importance of careful index design to prevent slowdowns during write operations.
