In SQL, a common mistake is to assume that an index will always speed up queries.  While indices are generally beneficial, they can sometimes hinder performance, especially with small tables or queries that don't heavily utilize the indexed columns. Additionally, improper index design, such as using too many indexes or indexes on large, rarely used columns, can cause write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) to become dramatically slower. Finally, using non-selective indexes for `WHERE` clauses can actually increase the query time, leading to more full-table scans.
